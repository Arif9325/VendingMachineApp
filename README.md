# Vending Machine

### Project for the Course: Programming 3

Welcome to our vending machine project! This project showcases a modern and interactive vending machine simulation developed in **WPF**. It provides users with a real-world shopping experience and offers dynamic inventory updates, payment options, and receipt generation. This project was developed by **Sayed Arif Shah** and **Khizer Choudary**.

## Game Overview

This vending machine application allows users to:

- Interact with a vending machine interface (see screenshots below).
- Add items to the shopping cart by pressing the **Add (+)** button.
- Remove items from the shopping cart using the **Remove (x)** button.
- Choose between **Card** or **Cash** payment methods.
- Automatically update the inventory based on item selection.

If the user attempts to check out without any items in the shopping cart, a dialog box will appear notifying them that the cart is empty.
